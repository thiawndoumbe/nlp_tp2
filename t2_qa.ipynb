      "[{'text': ' At around 10:00 p.m. on November 10  2013  Employee #1  with Villager  Construction Inc.  with a coworker  were using an asphalt milling machine  (Wirtgen; Model Number: W2100) to grind out existing asphalt from an  interstate at a railroad bridge overpass. Employee # 1 was standing on the  ground  checking the depth of the cut into the asphalt  using a handheld  pendant attached to the machine. The pedant could stretch out from ten to 15  ft. This allowed Employee #1 to walk back and forth  checking the cut. The  operator was on the top of the milling machine  controlling the operation of  the machine and ensuring that the milling machine and dump truck (driven by a  second coworker  who worked for an independent trucking service) kept a safe  working distance. A different company  Protective Services Inc. (PSI)  was  responsible for the traffic control of the job site and had shut down the  inside lane of a three lane section of the interstate  so that work could be  conducted on that lane. The entire work zone was approximately two miles long   from start to finish. Employee #1 and the operator of the milling machine had  completed milling four sections (eight total passes) of the inside lane at the  bridge overpasses and were waiting for PSI to shut down the center lane. Dual  lane shut down of the inside and center lanes of the interstate was completed  around 9:30 p.m.  and Employee #1 and the milling machine operator milled two  sections (four total passes) of the center lane. Once both sides of the  overpass were milled out  approximately 200 ft on each side  Employee #1 and  the operator of the milling machine moved the milling machine down the  interstate  approximately1 000 ft  to a railroad overpass and began setting up  to mill the center lane sections. The truck driver backed his truck into  position and remained in the truck to move the truck slowly forward as milling  took place. Employee #1 was positioned between the milling machine and the  concrete median dividers  inside the coned off work zone. The lanes of travel  were approximately 12 ft wide  so the milling machine made two passes  since  it can only cut seven ft wide on each section to cover the entire lane.  Employee #1 was standing approximately three ft in the far inside lane on the  ground between milling machine and interior median wall inside of the approved  traffic control set up  and approximately midway up the machine and 17 ft from  the traffic control devices and flow of traffic. The milling machine was  approximately nine ft wide by 50 ft long  while operating. Employee #1 was  guarded by the machine from the flow of traffic. Approximately five to ten  minutes into the first pass  the milling machine operator noticed lights  hitting the reflectors on the inside wall and turned briefly to see a vehicle  coming. The operator thought it was the Project manager coming to check on the  status of the project. Then  the operator realized that the oncoming vehicle  was not equipped with a strobe  as required in work zones. The operator turned  and yelled for Employee # 1 to run for safety  as a Chevrolet Tahoe came down  the inside lane where Employee #1 was standing. The driver of the Tahoe  continued traveling in the far inside lane of the work zone  where Employee #1  was struck and thrown some 100 ft from where he was originally standing. The  vehicle was moving approximately 45 mph per hour. As he was transferred to a  hospital by emergency personnel  Employee #1 was treated for severe trauma   lacerations  fractures  and contusions to the body and head. Employee #1 was  pronounced dead at the hospital. The driver of the vehicle disregarded the  traffic control set up  all warning lights on the rear of the milling machine   and cone spacing of 100 ft. The construction work zone was set up correctly  with all signage  cone spacing  tapering  attenuators  and lighting; all of  the traffic control set up was approved by MUTCD for this type of tr ', 'WHEN': 'November 10  2013', 'WHERE': 'railroad bridge overpass', 'EVENT': 'Employee #1  was struck and thrown'}, {'text': \" On August 27  2012  Employee #1  a 19 year-old male laborer with Stomper  Company Inc.  arrived at 2:00 .am. at a site in Menlo Park California to  demolish the interiors of the building.

Two coworkers were going to  load the number 5 700 Panther and Employee #1 stated that he was going to load  the number 5 700 Panther on a trailer when their trailer returns from the trip  delivering their first load. This worker got on a Gradall machine to lift a  box bin and move it towards the number 5 700 Panther. The coworkers stated  that Employee #1  not the employee designated to drive the Panther  got on  this vehicle and started driving it. Employee #1 attempted to load a number  5 700 Panther on to a bin. This bin had a rubber lip with a four to five inch  incline ramp on its lip's edge. Employee #1 drove the Panther straight  backwards on the bin and did not go through this four to five inch ramp bump  on to the bin. Right after this unsuccessful attempt  Employee #1 drove it  backwards a second time except this time slightly slanted to his left side.  The left wheel touched the ramp first. On this second attempt  the number  5 700 Panther fell and flipped over. Employee #1 attempted to jump out of this  vehicle but was unable to get away as the Panther which weighed over 2 000  pounds fell on his left foot and pinned it. A coworker got the Gradall  machinery in order to remove the Panther that was on top of Employee #1's left  foot.

The hopper section  consisted of 1-in. plate steel. The plates were welded vertically to the deck  and the side plates were welded at an angle with steel I beams for support to  deflect material to the center. The plates were approximately 8 ft high. The  barge was used to catch construction debris from a bridge that was being  demolished. After Employee #1 released the cable  a coworker who was operating  a tug boat  put the boat at notch one in reverse to back the barge out from  under the bridge. After moving approximately 2 ft the barge listed to  starboard approximately 6 to12 inches. It then rolled back to port the same  distance  then back to even keel. It then rolled back to port and capsized  both vessels. As the vessels were rolling to the port side  Employee #1 jumped  into the water and started to swim away. The coworker  at almost the same  time  jumped from the pilot house and swam away.

    "## Analyse\n",
    "\n",
    "Pour les trois questions, nous avons procédé de façon itérative, débutant avec les formulations les plus simples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quand?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pour les questions sur le moment de l'incident, nous avons immédiatement obtenu des résultats satisfaisants avec 23/25 pour l'« exact match ». Les deux erreurs sont dues au fait que la date n'est pas indiquée dans le rapport d'incident. La réponse retournée devrait alors être vide, cependant, le modèle retourne toujours du texte. Nous avons essayé d'ajouter une instruction au modèle pour ne rien retourner si la réponse n'est pas trouvée, cependant, le modèle ne semble pas avoir une capacité avancée de suivi d'instructions. La réponse retournée est toujours la même, peu importe la formulation de la question. Pour ce type de question, le modèle semble donc être robuste à la formulation de la question. Pour obtenir 25/25, il faudrait donc utiliser une méthode externe au modèle, telle que refuser ou accepter les réponses basées sur leur score.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Où?\n",
    "\n",
    "La deuxième question, \"Où?\", s'est avérée plus difficile que la première. Les réponses étant plus complexes, il n'est pas surprenant que les résultats soient inférieurs à la première question qui avait des dates clairement indiquées. Pour cette question, nous avons premièrement testé \"Where did the event happen?\" et \"Where did the incident happen?\" pour établir une référence pour les prochaines itérations. Nous avons ensuite testé différentes structures de questions telles que \"[Verbe2] the place where the [nom] [verbe1].\", \"Where did the [nom] [verbe1]?\" et \"What place did the [nom] [verbe1]?\" où [verbe1] est un choix parmi occurred, took place, was located, emerged, happened et [verbe2] est name, describe, find ou identify. Pour [nom], nous avons testé event et incident. La structure \"[Verbe2] the place where the [nom] [verbe1].\" a donné des résultats significativement inférieurs aux deux autres. Cela est probablement dû au fait que ce n'est pas formulé comme une question, mais plutôt comme une instruction. Les deux autres structures de questions ont peu d'impact sur les résultats. La meilleure question avec les données de test est \"What place did the event occur?\" avec un F1 score de 20.46/25 et un exact match de 17/25. Par contre, les autres alternatives sont relativement proches; le classement pourrait varier en utilisant un autre groupe de test. Surprenamment, la question contient une erreur, occurred devrait être occur, mais les résultats sont légèrement inférieurs si nous la corrigeons. Nous avons aussi testé simplement \"Where?\" ce qui donne de meilleurs résultats que le format par instruction, mais inférieurs à une question complète.\n",
    "\n",
    "La difficulté de la question vient probablement du fait que plusieurs endroits peuvent être donnés dans le rapport; le modèle doit ainsi être en mesure de trouver non seulement ce qui est un endroit, mais aussi l'endroit qui correspond à la question. Les résultats indiquent aussi que le modèle a obtenu certaines réponses partiellement bonnes, l'exact match étant inférieur au F1 score. Cela peut s'expliquer par le fait que le modèle pouvait retourner le bon endroit, mais ne fournissait pas exactement les informations attendues. Par exemple, pour un exemple, le modèle retourne \"drainage inlet structure\" alors que la réponse attendue était \"G-2 drainage inlet structure\". Le modèle a trouvé le bon endroit, mais il lui manque une information, ce qui lui donne un bon F1 score, mais pas un exact match.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quoi?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pour la description de l'incident, l'information a été beaucoup plus difficile à bien extraire. Pour trouver les bonnes informations, le modèle doit bien comprendre la question et le rapport. Contrairement à la deuxième question, le choix des mots a eu beaucoup d'impact. Dans un premier temps, nous avons testé \"What is the event?\" et \"What is the incident?\". Même s'il y a seulement un mot de différence entre les deux questions, la première a donné le pire résultat avec un F1 score de 2.34/25 et aucun exact match, et la deuxième est la meilleure parmi toutes les questions que nous avons testées avec un F1 score de 14.75/25 et un exact match de 11/25. Nous avons testé d'autres formulations et le format d'instructions donne de très bons résultats. Par exemple, \"Identify and summarize the incident that occurred.\" donne un F1 score de 13.54/25 et un exact match de 11/25, ce qui est très près du meilleur résultat.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remarques générales\n",
    "\n",
    "Basé sur nos expérimentations, les conclusions que nous avons tirées sont que la clarté de l'information recherchée impacte considérablement la capacité du modèle à retrouver l'information. La réponse à la question \"Quand?\" est claire alors que la réponse au \"Quoi?\" est plus subtile. Il y a plusieurs façons de formuler l'information et la longueur est très variable. Deuxièmement, les instructions avec la question ont peu d'impact, surtout sur les questions les plus simples telles que le \"Quand?\". Le modèle est incapable de ne rien retourner; il trouvera toujours une information à retourner même si elle ne correspond pas à l'information recherchée. Finalement, le choix de la structure et des mots peut avoir un grand impact dans certains cas, alors qu'il importe peu dans les autres cas."
